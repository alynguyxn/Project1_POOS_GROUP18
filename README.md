# Project1_POOS_GROUP18

Group Members & Roles:

Mario Calderon - Project Manager/UI  
Kayan Ho - UI  
Alyssa Nguyen - Database  
Jorje Toledo - UI  

Project Requirements:
Remote database
Use a LAMP stack. (Please do not use any Python-based framework)
Use JSON to communicate between client and server. During the presentation, you must show access to at least one API endpoint using SwaggerHub.
You will use a web page as the client. (A web page must be AJAX enabled that accesses the API. AJAX loosely means asynchronous.)

The program is a personal contact manager. Each user needs a login. If someone does not have an account, you need to offer a registration/signup mechanism. For each user, they can add their own contacts (not shared contacts). They can search for, edit, and delete contacts. When the initial page appears, users can either log in or sign up (register).

Please note: you must have a search API and not cache all contacts client side.
